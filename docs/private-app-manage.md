### Update a Private App 

Select the App you wish to modify, and then update the App information and permissions settings. Click the Save button to store the updated information on the Gateway. A pop-up window will confirm the successful App update . 

The Appâ€™s ClientID will not automatically regenerate when permissions or information is changed. If you are making significant changes to the permissions of an App we recommend either disabling or deleting the old Private App and creating a new one. 

Please note that deleting an App is an irreversible action.
