Data collection on patients with depression and anxiety disorders that are offered psychological therapies, so that we can improve the delivery of care for these conditions.\\n\\nProviders of NHS-funded IAPT services are required to submit data to NHS Digital on a monthly basis.\\n\\nAs a secondary uses data set the IAPT data set re-uses clinical and operational data for purposes other than direct patient care.
